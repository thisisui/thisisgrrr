This is Grrr - growl style
==========

Long time ago I release a growl package with growl theme called This is Grrr.
* To make it work just make a folder, then put folder "Contents" into that new folder.
* Change the name of the new folder to have special extension .growlStyle, for example ThisIsGrrr.growlStyle
* It should change into the growl style, you just have to click it to load it
